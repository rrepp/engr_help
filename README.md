This is a (lame) c++ project. There are many like it, but this one is my own.

The purpose of this repository is to learn c++ and git and as a bonus side-effect, become more proficient in vim.

My end goal is to create a simple application that will assist me with my engineering homework.

Though creating a fully fleshed out, gui-based system sounds like a lofty, worthwhile endeavor, I think I need to take much smaller steps. I'm not sure how far I'll take this project. I hesitate to define an exact scope, guideline, and project timeline. For now I think I'll define a less rigid structure. In fact, instead of a structured outline, I'll compose more of a to-do list and update as I see fit.

TO-DO LIST:

	- main() that loops with a menu of available commands and exits upon user request.
	- Menu of available commands
	- Commands:
		- Converting values bewteen different unit systems
		- Basic math (+, -, *, /)
		- More advanced math? Possibly implement
			- Reimann sums
			- Trapezoid Rule
			- Simpson's Rule
		- Outputting results to screen and possibly to a .txt file
		
		
*************** ideas for much later ***************
	{Have the program automatically collect all input and the output to a new file every time the program is run (Like naming a brand new text file with current date and time to avoid conflict or collision) or just add on to the end of a single file.}
	{Implement a username/password system using something like pgp(?) or SHA-256}
